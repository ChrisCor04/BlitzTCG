      <h2>How do I use BlitzTCG?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Simply sign up, add your cards to your collection, and start tracking their 
        value over time. Sometimes the card you want to add may not appear right away, if 
        this occurs try searching up the card with the exact code following it for example 
        you may search "Greninja ex" and not see a specific version of the card, in this case 
        try searching "Greninja ex - 214/167" to find the exact card you want to add. You can 
        view historical price trends of your collection through our charts and analyze market
        data to make informed decisions about buying or selling cards.
